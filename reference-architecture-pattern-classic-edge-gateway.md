# Reference Architecture
{: #reference-architecture}

This reference architecture is used to force all network traffic to flow through the classic firewall or gateway appliance for inspection before going to the downstream workloads within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

## Architecture diagram
{: #architecture-diagram}

This architecture describes on-premises data centers connectivity into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic, with workloads in classic, Power Virtual Server, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The diagram includes examples to show where workload compute instances, proxy servers, and jump servers are located. The following diagram identifies numbers indicating key components in the description.

1.  Client network connectivity from on-premises using redundant Direct Links.
2.  The gateway provides routing and security functions.
3.  An optional network path is accomplished through a site-to-site VPN terminated on a classic gateway.
4.  Power Virtual Server workspace with Power Edge Router (PER), subnets, and resources.
5.  The GREa tunnel allows BYOIP to be advertised between classic and on-premises.
6.  The GREb tunnel allows BYOIP to be advertised between classic and the PowerVS and VPC environments.
7.  The GREc tunnel allows BYOIP to be advertised between classic environments in separate regions.
8.  Virtual Bastion host for remote administrative access.
9.  DNS services.
10. A proxy server is used as an intermediary between on-premises and cloud services.
11. Cloud Internet Services (CIS) is used to enhance the security, performance, and reliability of internet-facing applications and websites.
12. A compute instance in a Virtual Private Cloud.
13. A virtual private endpoint for VPC.
14. An application load balancer.

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Following the [{{site.data.keyword.arch_framework}}](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), the classic edge gateway network pattern covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- **Compute:** Virtual Servers
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, BYOIP/Edge Gateways, Network Segmentation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Load Balancing, and DNS
- **Security:** Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **Resiliency:** High Availability, Disaster Recovery
- **Service management:** Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting, Event Management

![illustrates a detailed network and component architecture for a Classic edge gateway solution architecture](image/Heat-map.svg){: caption="Figure 2. Classic edge gateway design scope" caption-side="bottom"}

The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. For more information, see [Introduction to the {{site.data.keyword.arch_framework}}](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro).
